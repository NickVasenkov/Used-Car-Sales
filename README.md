# Used Car Sales
 Beating the human performance in estimating the price a car will sell for: https://github.com/NickVasenkov/Used-Car-Sales/blob/main/Used-Car-Sales.ipynb

The request from the sales team: "Can you help us estimate the price we should list a car for? The team estimates are always around 30% away from the price we know the car will sell for, we really want to be within 10% of the price."
